                    <h3>What is FAFSA?</h3>
                    <p>The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is the official form students complete to apply for federal financial aid for college. As an RN pursuing your BSN, you may be eligible for grants, loans, and work-study programs that can significantly reduce your education costs.</p>

                        <p><strong>Important:</strong> Completing the FAFSA is required to access federal student aid, and many state and institutional aid programs also require it.</p>

                    <h3>Special Considerations for RN to BSN Students</h3>

                    <h4>Dependency Status</h4>
                    <p>Most RN to BSN students are considered independent students if they:</p>
                    <ul class="features-list">
                        <li>Are age 24 or older</li>
                        <li>Are married</li>
                        <li>Have dependents</li>
                        <li>Are veterans or active military</li>
                        <li>Are working toward a master's or doctoral degree</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Independent students can borrow more in federal student loans and don't need parental information on the FAFSA.</p>

                    <h4>Previous Degree Holders</h4>
                    <p>If you already have a bachelor's degree, you are <strong>not</strong> eligible for Pell Grants or subsidized loans. However, you can still receive unsubsidized loans.</p>

                    <h4>Enrollment Status</h4>
                    <p>Aid amounts may be adjusted based on enrollment status:</p>
                    <ul class="features-list">
                        <li><strong>Full-time:</strong> 12+ credits per semester (maximum aid)</li>
                        <li><strong>Three-quarter time:</strong> 9-11 credits (75% of aid)</li>
                        <li><strong>Half-time:</strong> 6-8 credits (50% of aid)</li>
                        <li><strong>Less than half-time:</strong> 1-5 credits (may not qualify for all aid types)</li>

                    <h3>Common Questions</h3>

                    <h4>Do I need to reapply for FAFSA every year?</h4>
                    <p>Yes. You must complete the FAFSA each academic year you want to receive federal student aid.</p>

                    <h4>Can I get FAFSA for an online RN to BSN program?</h4>
                    <p>Yes, as long as the program is at an accredited institution and is eligible for Title IV federal student aid.</p>

                    <h4>What if my financial situation has changed?</h4>
                    <p>Contact your school's financial aid office about a "professional judgment" review if you've had significant changes like job loss, divorce, or medical expenses.</p>

                    <h4>Can I work full-time and still receive financial aid?</h4>
                    <p>Yes. Working doesn't disqualify you from aid, though your income will be considered in the financial need calculation.</p>
