                    <h4>Strategies for Success:</h4>
                    <ol class="requirements-list">
                        <li><strong>Start Early:</strong> Begin tracking qualifying payments for PSLF from your first job</li>
                        <li><strong>Submit ECF Forms Annually:</strong> Don't wait years to verify your employment</li>
                        <li><strong>Consider Combining Programs:</strong> Some nurses use NURSE Corps for immediate repayment, then PSLF for remaining balance</li>
                        <li><strong>Check Employer Eligibility:</strong> Use the PSLF Help Tool to verify your employer qualifies</li>
                        <li><strong>Stay Informed:</strong> Program rules and deadlines change; monitor official websites</li>
                        <li><strong>Keep Records:</strong> Save all payment confirmations and employment documentation</li>
                        <li><strong>Recertify Annually:</strong> Income-driven repayment plans require annual recertification</li>
